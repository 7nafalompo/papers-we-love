## Features and Benefits of KUKA Sim Pro 2.1
 
KUKA Sim Pro 2.1 is a powerful simulation software that offers many features and benefits for offline programming of KUKA robots. Some of the main features and benefits are:

- It supports all current and older robot models, including SCARA and DELTA robots[^2^].
- It allows you to create 3D layouts of robot systems and components using an integrated CAD reader[^1^] [^2^].
- It enables you to generate robot trajectories on CAD parts, with options for approach and depart patterns, start position definition, path regression and smoothing[^1^] [^2^].
- It provides a realistic simulation of robot motion sequences in real time, with features such as swept volume function, simple and advanced collision detection, and stopping distance simulation[^1^] [^2^].
- It connects to KUKA.OfficeLite, the virtual KUKA controller, for advanced KRL programming, variable view, fieldbus configuration, RoboTeam configuration and program code generation[^1^] [^2^].
- It offers cycle time analysis and optimization for increased productivity and efficiency[^1^].
- It supports virtual commissioning with OPC-UA interface and integration with other software tools such as WINMOD, Siemens SIMIT and WorkVisual[^2^].
- It allows you to simulate welding applications with ArcTech Basic, with options for single-robot with positioner or linear units, torch preview on path, standard weaving pattern and ILF support[^2^].
- It has a modular software architecture that can be expanded with three add-ons: KUKA.Sim Modeling AddOn for advanced component modeling, KUKA.Sim Connectivity AddOn for advanced virtual commissioning and KUKA.Sim ArcWelding AddOn for offline programming with ArcTech Basic[^1^] [^2^].
- It has a user-friendly interface with 3D Connexion Space mouse support, 2D drawing feature, 3D PDF export, AVI export and animation file export for mobile viewer app or VR glasses[^1^] [^2^].

With these features and benefits, KUKA Sim Pro 2.1 is a valuable tool for planning, designing, testing and optimizing your robot applications before they are implemented in the real world.
